# Cryptrack
A simple crypto-currency tracker android app using Kotlin. \
Currently contains the price of each cryptocurrency with its rate of change for the past 24 hours as well as the past 7 days.

# Notes
This is my first project using Kotlin, I will be adding features to the app every now and then. \
If you have any Kotlin "best practices" or any improvements on the way I'm using it feel free to share.
